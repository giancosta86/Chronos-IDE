## Requirements

Chronos IDE requires Java 8 update 51 or later compatible version.


## Download and run

The easier, suggested way to execute Chronos IDE is via [MoonDeploy](https://github.com/giancosta86/moondeploy): just go to the [download area](https://github.com/giancosta86/Chronos-IDE/releases/latest) and open *App.moondeploy* to automatically download and execute the application.

The latest binary package can be downloaded [from GitHub](https://github.com/giancosta86/Chronos-IDE/releases/latest).

The executable program - for both Unix and Windows - is in the *bin* subdirectory.

In case of problems while starting up the application, please check your Java version and your [JAVA_HOME environment variable](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/index.html): starting the program from the command line should also print out a detailed error description.

## Further references

Chronos IDE is based on [OmniEditor](https://github.com/giancosta86/OmniEditor), a JavaFX library encapsulating a fully-functional, customizable IDE for programming languages.

Chronos IDE also employs the [Chronos](https://github.com/giancosta86/Chronos) engine.

All the *special thanks* mentioned in the related README files apply to Chronos IDE as well.
